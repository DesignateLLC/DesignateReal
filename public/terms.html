  <h2>1. Introduction and Purpose</h2>
  <p>Designate provides a technology platform that connects individuals seeking safe transportation, especially after consuming alcohol, with independent, sober drivers. The platform is not restricted solely to individuals under the influence but is open to all users seeking secure, professional transportation. Our primary mission is to reduce impaired driving and provide a convenient and trustworthy alternative to ensure users reach their destination safely.</p>
